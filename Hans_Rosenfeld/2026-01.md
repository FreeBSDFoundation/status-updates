## **Reporting Period:** [2026-01-12 - [2026-01-18]

### Project: Full CPUID Control for bhyve
#### **Overall Status:** [Delayed]
#### **Summary**
Ported illumos#16647 (https://illumos.org/issues/16647 ). This automatically changes CPUID bits which need to reflect on CPU configuration changes made by the guest. This required a port of a small part of illumos#14598 (https://illumos.org/issues/14598) to work.

Rebased everything on recent bhyve header refactoring.

#### **Completed Tasks**
- strtonumx() got committed (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54270 )
- walk_config_nodes() for bhyve got committed  (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D51551 )

#### **Next Steps**
Implement support for partial/sparse CPUID configuration.
