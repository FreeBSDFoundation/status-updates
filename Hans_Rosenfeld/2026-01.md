# January 2025 Status Update for Hans Rosenfeld

[//]: <Week 4>
## **Reporting Period:** [2026-01-19] - [2026-01-25]

### Project: Full CPUID Control for bhyve
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
Re-tested existing CPUID changes after rebase. Began devising a rework of the
kernel bits to allow sparse configuration and automated overrides of static or
VM-state dependent information (as in illumos #16647). Began implementing
`bhyvectl --get-cpuid=<leaf>[,<index>]` to ease testing.
#### **Completed Tasks**
The bhyve header changes ( https://reviews.freebsd.org/D51550 ) have been
committed by markj. Thanks!

#### **Next Steps**
Get the bhyvectl changes working. Implement partial/sparse CPUID configuration
support in vmm.

### Miscellaneous
#### **Challenges**
For the 3rd time in 2 weeks I rebased my work onto the latest main branch and
had to deal with unrelated build failures and/or system panics. Is that
something that's generally to be expected when tracking main? Should I rebase
less often?

[//]: <Week 3>
## **Reporting Period:** [2026-01-12 - [2026-01-18]

### Project: Full CPUID Control for bhyve
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
Ported illumos#16647 (https://illumos.org/issues/16647 ). This automatically changes CPUID bits which need to reflect on CPU configuration changes made by the guest. This required a port of a small part of illumos#14598 (https://illumos.org/issues/14598) to work.

Rebased everything on recent bhyve header refactoring.

#### **Completed Tasks**
- strtonumx() got committed (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54270 )
- walk_config_nodes() for bhyve got committed  (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D51551 )

#### **Next Steps**
Implement support for partial/sparse CPUID configuration.
