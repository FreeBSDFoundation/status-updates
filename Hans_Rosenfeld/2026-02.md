# February 2026 Status Update for Hans Rosenfeld

[//]: <Week 6>
## **Reporting Period:** [2026-02-02] - [2026-02-08]

### Project: Full CPUID Control for bhyve
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
Not much happened last week as I was tied up with other tasks, such as getting
the VirtIO-SCSI work on illumos out the door.

#### **Next Steps**
Adapt the CPUID configuration and emulation code to allow for "sparse"
configurations.  This can be handled by extending the CPUID emulation to look
up CPUID values from the configuration, and only falling back to a native CPUID
instruction if none exists.

### Miscellaneous
#### **Summary**
I've finished the code review on the illumos side of things for the VirtIO-SCSI
project, things are ready for integration on their side.

Thanks Ed for committing the first bunch of changes for FreeBSD.

If anyone has interest in VirtIO-SCSI or spare cycles for review, there are a
few more (and bigger) changes that still need reviewing:

The following reviews will be updated shortly to match the latest state in illumos
and also still need review:
