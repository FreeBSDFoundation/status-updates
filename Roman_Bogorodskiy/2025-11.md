# 11 2025 Status Update for Roman Bogorodskiy

## **Reporting Period:** [2025-11-03] - [2025-11-09]

### Project: libvirt on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

This week I've merged the previously approved libvirt patches.
Updated the libvirt port to the new release, and updated the related ports
(Python and Perl bindings).

Updated the [libvirt documentation](https://libvirt.org/drvbhyve.html)
to describe passthrough support, along with other minor fixes,
which is [on review](https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/thread/7TYN7PI7E66UAF5ZOJWXOWGYB2S4KBBE/)
now.

Started working on specifying queue options for the NVMe devices, hope
to complete this next week. 

#### **Completed Tasks**

 * Merged PCI passthrough support,
 * Merged domain startup error handling improvement,
 * Updated libvirt port to 11.9.0, and related ports.

#### **Blockers**

Same as before + created a bug report for the
[resume issue](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290735).

#### **Next Steps** 

I plan to complete the patches I've started working on. Once complete, need to pick up
work on the [nodedev](https://libvirt.org/drvnodedev.html) support which is used
to manage host devices (including configuring them for passthrough).
