# 12 2025 Status Update for Roman Bogorodskiy

## **Reporting Period:** [2025-12-01] - [2025-12-07]

### Project: libvirt on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Posted a couple of patches for
[bhyve](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54087) and
[bhyvectl](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54092) to hopefully continue the
[discussion](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-virtualization/2025-November/003322.html)
on the suspend/resume interface.

I have rebased my patch for the bootindex support to test it
with other guests than Ubuntu Linux, but still hit the
[bug](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279720).
Might try it on `releng/14` as well to check whether it's a regression.

Also started looking into adding two more features to the libvirt's bhyve driver:

 * Guest NUMA domains configuration (`bhyve -n`),
 * Virtio-scsi device support.

#### **Completed Tasks**

 * Ports were updated to 11.10.0. That was also merged back to the 2025Q4
   due to the security issues this release addresses.

#### **Blockers**

Same as before.

#### **Next Steps**

 * Addressing review comments on the already submitted patches and
   working on the new features (NUMA and virtio-scsi).
