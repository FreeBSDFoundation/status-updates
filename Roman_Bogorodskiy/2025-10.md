### Project: libvirt on FreeBSD
* **Overall Status:** On Track
* **Summary**

This week I worked on adding the virtio-input device support.
I implemented the libvirt part, but I wasn't able to get
the device actually working.

On Linux it doesn't work because apparently Linux requires virtio 1.0,
while bhyve supports 0.9. I tried to [revive](https://github.com/novel/freebsd-src/tree/D29708-rebase)
the [unmerged patch](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D29708),
but it didn't help still.

It [does not work](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290364)
on the Windows guest as well, so I'm postponing this work until I can
have it tested.

For now I've started adding driver support for the NVMe devices.

* **Completed Tasks**

  - The libvirt-tck [merge request for enabling hooks tests for bhyve](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-tck/-/merge_requests/72) was merged,
  - devel/py-avocado-framework (testing framework for libvirt-tck) updated to 112.0.

* **Blockers**

  - [bootindex=N](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279720),
  - [Suspend/resume issues](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-virtualization/2025-October/003191.html), probably need to make a PR for this one,
  - [TPM issues](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=287326), that works on FreeBSD guests, but not on Ubuntu, could probably complete the feature anyway.

* **Next Steps** 

Complete and test nvme devices support for the libvirt bhyve driver.
