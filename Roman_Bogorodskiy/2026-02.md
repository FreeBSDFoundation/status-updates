# 02 2026 Status Update for Roman Bogorodskiy

## **Reporting Period:** [2026-02-09] - [2026-02-15]

### Project: libvirt on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Getting close to libvirt-tck/arm64 test runs, currently have:

```
RESULTS    : PASS 23 | ERROR 4 | FAIL 1 | SKIP 2 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0                                                                                                                                                                                      
JOB TIME   : 1291.50 s  
```

Merged a couple of the libvirt/bhyve driver patches that make running arm64 easier.

The cpu pinning patch for the libvirt/bhyve driver still waits for review. 

#### **Completed Tasks**

 * Merged the bhyve/arm64 loader handling improvements.
 * Merged deprecation of the legacy options.

#### **Blockers**

Outline of the `bhyve` issues that are either blockers or create
a noticeable inconvenience for development:

 * [bootindex not working](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279720),
 * [resume issues](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290735),
 * [tpm issues](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=287326),
 * [virtio-input not working](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290364),
 * [arm64 CPU frequency reporting not working](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=291810),
 * Lack of capabilities reporting in bhyve.

#### **Next Steps**

 * Continue working on arm64 support.
 * Triage the remaining test failures for libvirt-tck/arm64.

## **Reporting Period:** [2026-02-02] - [2026-02-08]

### Project: libvirt on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

This week I was mainly iterating on the reviews on my libvirt/bhyve arm64 related patches.

I have also completed the vcpu pinning configuration support which is now also
[on review](https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/thread/CVIUH4DX5ELQFYKPHRQ6OXBJ6STU264D/).

Moving forward with running libvirt-tck integration tests on the Quartz64 board.
At the moment I have it running against libvirt built from my integration branch.
There are some failures and errors. For domain tests I get:

```
RESULTS    : PASS 19 | ERROR 5 | FAIL 5 | SKIP 1 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0                                                                                                                                                                                      
JOB TIME   : 1043.44 s   
```

I believe at least some of them are caused by configuration issues. Will continue looking into that.

#### **Completed Tasks**

 * None for this week.

#### **Blockers**

Outline of the `bhyve` issues that are either blockers or create
a noticeable inconvenience for development:

 * [bootindex not working](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279720),
 * [resume issues](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290735),

 * Lack of capabilities reporting in bhyve.

#### **Next Steps**

 * Continue working on arm64 support.
 * Extend my libvirt-ci with libvirt-tck runs on the Quartz64 board.
