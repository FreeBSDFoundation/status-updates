## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-19 - 2026-01-25


## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-12 - 2026-01-18

### Miscellaneous
#### **Summary**

Started the New Year by catching up and preparing for the next release.

#### ** Completed Tasks**

- [x] MFC to stable/15 and stable/14.  The latter saw about 75 changes
      being merged (some squashed), with more pending in case we get positive
      testing feedback before 14.4-RELEASE deadlines no longer allow us to
      merge driver and functionality updates.
      The merges include common LinuxKPI code (some shared with drm-kmod)
      as well as non-intrusive LinuxKPI 802.11 changes, a build fix in case
      of a missing compiler feature, fwget fixes, and some general bug fixes.
      The majority of the changes can be seen by issuing
		```git log --oneline 0b6bb8193597..16e2bb8177bd```
      on a stable/14 branch.

- [x] After a user report that iwlwifi(4) works on RISC-V we enabled
      firmware and module builds for the LinuxKPI based wireless drivers
      in main (16) and stable/15.

- [x] Working on rates and due to some discussion around more LinuxKPI
      802.11 compat needed I started splitting parts up between mac80211
      and cfg80211 routines while I was touching them anyway.

- [x] The 2025Q4 report got updated, accepted and pushed as well.

- [x] Followed-up on problem reports (PRs) and closed some.

#### ** Ongoing Tasks **

- [ ] Upstream the works from end of last year along with other bits I
      have been owrking on in private given there is wider interest to
      that currently.

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-05 - 2026-01-11

Mostly AFK.

Some Emails and dealing with PRs.

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-12-29 - 2026-01-04

I was mostly out.

### Miscellaneous
#### **Summary**

Maintaining wireless drivers, bug fixes, and LinuxKPI changes for wireless.

#### **Ongoing and Completed Tasks**

- [ ] Tracking down a regression, which may as well be responsible for some
      otherwise unrelated problem reports.
