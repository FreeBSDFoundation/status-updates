### Project: 802.11ac support for Realtek rtw88 and rtw89 wireless drivers
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Realtek rtw88(4) and rtw89(4) wireless drivers are currently limited to
802.11a/b/g due to extra LinuxKPI support needed beyond the KPI usage
of iwlwifi(4).

#### **Blockers**

- [ ] make rtw88 authenticate again (which also is a blocker for
      15.0-RELEASE)

#### **Next Steps**

- [ ] 11n and 11ac support for rtw88
- [ ] 11n and 11ac support for rtw89
