### Other bus attachment support
#### **Summary**

Given there is interest in SDIO support again I continued cleaning up my
branch which contains the USB and SDIO attachment changes.

#### ** Ongoing and Completed Tasks**

- [x] Opened review for LinuxKPI USB and preconditions

- [x] Updated review for quirk to eject the CDROM which comes builtin
      with some wireless dongled containing Windows/OSX drivers.

- [x] Opened further reviews for rtw88 USB and rtw89 USB

- [x] Got packets on both rtw88 and rtw89 USB devices

- [ ] Looked at mt76 USB as well and started to implement missing bits
      (for more, see Mediatek item below)

There is a review stack starting at https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54878
(find the "Stack" option in the "Revision Contents" block to see the
full list).

Once the entire stack is reviewed it is likely that we will have basic
wireless support for modern USB dongles (as supported by Linux as well).
There are more Realtek (and Mediatek?) chipsets out there which are not
yet supported but the assumption is that all relevant ones will be added
to the upstream open source drivers over time.

### Project: Mediatek mt76 wireless driver work on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** Ongoing and Blocked
#### **Summary**

Mt76 is going to be the priority for the next weeks again.

#### **Ongoing**

- [ ] forward port and merge the LinuxKPI page changes to the branch with
      the updated Linux v6.19-rc based drivers.  There were internal changes
      related to DMA32 and hope is that some workarounds implemented during
      bringup can be removed again.

- [ ] Check for any updates needed for drm-kmod integrating PAGE_IS_LKPI_PAGE
      work on the updated master branch.

#### **Blockers**

- [ ] LinuxKPI `struct page` integration/review.
- [ ] LinuxKPI `page pool` integration/review.

I will try to see if this can happen, once I am done with forward merging
and testing.

### Open Issues

#### **Blockers on Reviews**

- [ ] Updating the rtw89 driver to resolve
      PR https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=285228
      is blocked on
      https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54808
      https://reviews.freebsd.org/D55029 (approved)

- [ ] mt76 needs the following two reviews to be resolved:
      https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54811
      https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54841

- [ ] It is unclear for which driver I had hit this currently but it needs
      to happen anyway:
      https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54861

#### ** Other open TODO and in-progress **

- [ ] Folding the LinuxKPI 802.11 state machine functions back together
      is a pre-condition for the next iwlwifi item.

- [ ] Updating iwlwifi is blocked on an internal LinuxKPI 802.11 change.
      Hope this is going to happen next week.
      There should be another follow-up change or two to fix some recently
      submitted PRs.

- [ ] Merge further LinuxKPI 802.11 changes to enable 11n/11ac
      on rtw8x drivers

- [ ] Then put LinuxKPI SDIO support into review
