# December 2025 Status Update for Isaac Freund

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)

Kept working on pkgbasify this week, it seems that many more people are using it
now judging by the speed of the bug reports when I break something... oops.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Added a `--jail` option for pkgbasify to ensure the correct freebsd version is targeted when used with jails.
- Fixed 2 bugs introduced by the `--rootdir` patch
	- One was arguably a lua footgun: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify/commit/fd51b27e825fe3eb21801fccc897bbab47ec9ac8

#### **Next Steps**

- Integrate `pkg install --register-only`/`pkg unregister` into pkgbasify.
- Rework pkgbasify to use pkg sets like bsdinstall (I neglected to update pkgbasify when bsdinstall was reworked)
	- Sets are only available for 15.0, so we need to keep the old code for 14.X.
- Get back into working on pkg issue https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-12-02 - 2025-12-09

Spent most of my time on pkgbasify this week, improving flexibility and
evaluating the new `pkg install --register-only` and `pkg unregister` for use.
They haven't yet landed in a pkg release, but I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

- `pkg install --register-only` still requires downloading all packages even
though only the manifests are actually used, further improvement could be made
here though perhaps it is "good enough"

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Finished implementing and debugging a `--rootdir` option for pkgbasify https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify/pull/34

#### **Next Steps**

- Add a `--jail` option for pkgbasify to ensure the correct freebsd version is targeted when used with jails.
- Get back into working on pkg issue https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520
- Review https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2563 and consider for integration into pkgbasify (would be useful to speed up my personal testing if nothing else)
