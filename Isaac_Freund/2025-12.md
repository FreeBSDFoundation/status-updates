# December 2025 Status Update for Isaac Freund

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-12-02 - 2025-12-09

Spent most of my time on pkgbasify this week, improving flexibility and
evaluating the new `pkg install --register-only` and `pkg unregister` for use.
They haven't yet landed in a pkg release, but I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

- `pkg install --register-only` still requires downloading all packages even
though only the manifests are actually used, further improvement could be made
here though perhaps it is "good enough"

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Finished implementing and debugging a `--rootdir` option for pkgbasify https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify/pull/34

#### **Next Steps**

- Add a `--jail` option for pkgbasify to ensure the correct freebsd version is targeted when used with jails.
- Get back into working on pkg issue https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520
- Review https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2563 and consider for integration into pkgbasify (would be useful to speed up my personal testing if nothing else)
