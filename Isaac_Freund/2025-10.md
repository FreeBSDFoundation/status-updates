# October 2025 Status Update for Isaac Freund

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)
## **Reporting Period:** [2025-10-14] - [2025-10-21]

### Project: pkg
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Worked towards solving https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2538

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Added debugging code to export the scheduling graph as a graphviz DOT file.
- This was a very good decision, being able to visually inspect non-trivial graphs from real upgrades rather than isolated unit tests immediately revealed some undesirable behavior.
- Started tweaking the definition of edges (dependencies) in the scheduling graph to address the issue.

#### **Features Delivered**

- Nothing for the end-user, the current goal is to fix buggy behavior in pkg.

#### **Challenges**

- pkg's test suite only covers small isolated cases and doesn't always reflect real-world usage.

#### **Blockers**

- Nothing currently

#### **Next Steps**

- More testing for the behavioral changes to the scheduler
- Fix the unit test currently broken by these changes.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

- Will this be enough to fully address https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2538 in practice or will further performance improvements be needed? I have several performance enhancements planned out but don't need to spend time implementing them if this behavioral change is sufficient.
