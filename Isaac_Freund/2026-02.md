# January 2026 Status Update for Isaac Freund

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-02-10 - 2026-02-17

I got sucked in to work on other things and didn't make much FreeBSD-related progress this week.

#### **Work in progress**

- Investigated a pkgbasify issue reported by Pierre: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/pkgbasify/issues/46
- pkgbasify --register-only rework is in about the same shape as last week, I
  have nothing new to report here yet but did continue experimenting and trying to
  figure out which approach makes the most sense.

#### **Waiting on review**

- pkgbase: remove incorrect clang shlib requires [D54792](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54792)
    - This solves the issue originally reported in https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2594
- pkgbase: only provide shlibs from /lib,/usr/lib,/usr/lib32 [D54793](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54793)

#### **Next Steps**

- Take another look into https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520, check for
  any other cases similar to the FreeBSD-clang situation that should be fixed by
  ignoring specific shared libraries.
- Clean up the pkgbase wiki page and remove outdated information.

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-02-03 - 2026-02-10

This week I got back to working on pkgbasify changes to avoid overwriting files during
installation.

#### **Work in progress**

Blockers for `--register-only` usage in pkgbasify:
- pkg test should run cleanly after conversion of a clean, up-to-date system
- Require user to update system using freebsd-update first?
    - will the most recent pkgbase packages available from pkg.FreeBSD.org always match
      the most recent version available from freebsd update? Probably not...
- pkg check error may be impossible to solve if securelevel is greater than 0
  (default for popular jail managers such as bastille)
    - A new `pkg fix` alternative to `pkg install -f` for reinstalling a package
      that only reinstalls files where the checksum does not match could
      alleviate this.
- mismatch between how dist sets and pkgbase split /usr/tests into separate sets/packages causes pkg check failures

I also still have two pkgbase-related src patches waiting on review:

- pkgbase: remove incorrect clang shlib requires [D54792](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54792)
    - This solves the issue originally reported in https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2594
- pkgbase: only provide shlibs from /lib,/usr/lib,/usr/lib32 [D54793](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54793)

#### **Next Steps**

- Take another look into https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520, check for
  any other cases similar to the FreeBSD-clang situation that should be fixed by
  ignoring specific shared libraries.
