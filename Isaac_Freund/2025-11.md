# November 2025 Status Update for Isaac Freund

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)


## **Reporting Period:** 2025-11-11 - 2025-11-18

### Project: pkg
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**

Continued investigation into https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520 while fixing/investigating other pkg issues in parallel.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Fixed an issue resulting in bad user-facing error reporting: https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2559
- Wrote up an investigation of a pkg bug report adjacent to https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520, suggesting an improvement to be made in the packaging of FreeBSD-clang: https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2544#issuecomment-3547962377

#### **Features Delivered**

- Useful pkg error messages for basic networking issues

#### **Challenges**

- The pkg solver is poorly isolated from the rest of the pkg codebase and it is hard to understand what exactly the inputs to the solver algorithm are/where they come from. This is essentially the root cause of https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520.
- The pkg solver does not have good test coverage or documentation, which makes it difficult to determine if changes are correct or not.

#### **Blockers**

- Nothing but my available time/energy currently.

#### **Next Steps**

- I want to make it easier to test the solver, in particular I want to be able to pass some debug option to pkg which captures all inputs to the solver and saves them to a file for replaying/testing/debugging.
- I want to submit a patch implementing the FreeBSD-clang packaging change I proposed here: https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2544#issuecomment-3547962377

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

- None


## **Reporting Period:** 2025-11-04 - 2025-11-11

### Project: pkg
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**

Spent a few more hours on pkg issue https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Still reading and doing my best to understand enough of the scheduler to confidently make changes.

#### **Features Delivered**

- None so far

#### **Challenges**

- The pkg solver is poorly isolated from the rest of the pkg codebase and it is hard to understand what exactly the inputs to the solver algorithm are/where they come from. This is essentially the root cause of https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2520.
- The pkg solver does not have good test coverage or documentation, which makes it difficult to determine if changes are correct or not.

#### **Blockers**

- Nothing but my available time/energy currently.

#### **Next Steps**

- I have some other, likely more straightforward, issues on my TODO list. I may
  take a break from this pkg solver issue and work on them in parallel:
    - https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290375
    - https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/2498

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

- None
