### Project: Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is an EU regulation for improving cybersecurity
and cyber resilience in the EU, such as required incident reports and
automatic security updates. The FreeBSD Foundation is most likely to be
considered as an Open Source Steward per the CRA, and as such to be subject to
a subset of CRA obligations in its support capacity for the FreeBSD Project,
since it is used for commercial activities.

The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group (ORC WG) from the Eclipse
Foundation helps Open Source maintainers and users meet the compliance
requirements of the CRA.

The FreeBSD Foundation participates to the ORC WG in its capacity as interface
and facilitator between the users, maintainers, upstreams, and downstreams of
the FreeBSD Project. The objective is to achieve and support compliance with
the CRA for the FreeBSD community at large.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Follow-up to the cross-project and cross-foundation meetings from EuroBSDCon
  2025 (curl, Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, FreeBSD Foundation, NetBSD
  Foundation)
* Catch-up on the [AEgis initiative](https://security.erlef.org/aegis/) from
  the EEF

#### **Next Steps**

* Brief Alice Sowerby on the latest status, ahead of her trip to the Code &
  Compliance day in Brussels (October 22-23)
* Inform the security team about the AEgis initiative from the EEF Security WG

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

* Positioning of the FreeBSD Foundation WRT CRA and Stewardship
