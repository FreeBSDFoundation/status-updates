### Project: Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is an EU regulation for improving cybersecurity
and cyber resilience in the EU, such as required incident reports and
automatic security updates. The FreeBSD Foundation is most likely to be
considered as an Open Source Steward per the CRA, and as such to be subject to
a subset of CRA obligations in its support capacity for the FreeBSD Project,
since it is used for commercial activities.

The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group (ORC WG) from the Eclipse
Foundation helps Open Source maintainers and users meet the compliance
requirements of the CRA.

The FreeBSD Foundation participates to the ORC WG in its capacity as interface
and facilitator between the users, maintainers, upstreams, and downstreams of
the FreeBSD Project. The objective is to achieve and support compliance with
the CRA for the FreeBSD community at large.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Follow-up to the cross-project and cross-foundation meetings with the NetBSD
  Foundation (discussion resuming in one week)
* Briefed Alice Sowerby on the latest status, ahead of her trip to the Code &
  Compliance day in Brussels (October 22-23)
* Caught up with the outcome of the Code & Compliance day; attestations are in
  the air again
* Informed secteam@ and srcmgr@ about the AEgis initiative from the EEF Security
  WG

#### **Next Steps**

* Keep up with the ongoing progress and discussions
* Remain in touch with secteam@ and srcmgr@

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

* Positioning of the FreeBSD Foundation WRT CRA and Stewardship
* Same WRT (self) attestations
