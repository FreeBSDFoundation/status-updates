  for Alpha-Omega
* Tool rework and new “blame” command for tracking code ownership
* Generation of reports in the `CODEOWNERS` format (per the [GitHub

### Project: Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is an EU regulation for improving cybersecurity
and cyber resilience in the EU, such as required incident reports and
automatic security updates. The FreeBSD Foundation is most likely to be
considered as an Open Source Steward per the CRA, and as such to be subject to
a subset of CRA obligations in its support capacity for the FreeBSD Project,
since it is used for commercial activities.

The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group (ORC WG) from the Eclipse
Foundation helps Open Source maintainers and users meet the compliance
requirements of the CRA.

The FreeBSD Foundation participates to the ORC WG in its capacity as interface
and facilitator between the users, maintainers, upstreams, and downstreams of
the FreeBSD Project. The objective is to achieve and support compliance with
the CRA for the FreeBSD community at large.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Planning participation to the next Code & Compliance meeting in Brussels
  ahead of FOSDEM
* Joined the ORC WG SIG and CRA Attestation calls

#### **Next Steps**

* Catch up with the activity when returning next year

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

* Positioning of the FreeBSD Foundation WRT CRA and Stewardship
