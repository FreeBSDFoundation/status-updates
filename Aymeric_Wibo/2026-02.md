**Overall Status:** On Track

### Project: Laptop S0i3 Support

#### **Summary**

- Open & commit [D55119 - acpi: Fix trying to enter NONE state](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D55119).
- Completely rewrite [D55118 - acpi: Ask SPMC for D-state in s2idle instead of _S255D](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D55118) to actually use SPMC constraints for getting D-states when doing s2idle instead of reading `_SxD` objects.
- Land [D52497 - sys/power.h: `enum power_sstate_transition`](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D52497).
- Review [D54926 - acpi: Move sysctl tree set up at end of initialization](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54926).
- Review [D54627 - acpi: New R/O 'hw.acpi.s4bios_supported' sysctl, gate S4BIOS with it](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54627).
- Get back into USB4 work a little, including [D52861 - thunderbolt: Support generic USB4 NHIs](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D52861).
- Review & commit [D55102 - thunderbolt: Fix tb_pcib device matching to check PCI class](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D55102).
- Review [D54881 - intel/intel_pmc_core: Add Intel PMC Core driver](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54881).
- Revert [D54406 - acpi: Make taskqueue only run on BSP](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54406), which was causing problems for S3 on some systems.
- More work trying to figure out C3 exit.

#### **Next Steps**

- Figure out what the issue with making taskqueue only run on BSP is (this might help figure out the C3 exit issue thing too).
- Committing [D48721 - amdsmu: Sleep entry/exit hints for PMFW](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48721).
- Commit Intel PMC driver - now just wondering about the `access_denied` thing.
