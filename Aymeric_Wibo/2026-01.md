# January 2026 Status Update for Aymeric Wibo

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-12-31 - 2025-01-06

### Project: Graphics Stack Development

**Overall Status:** Just a small detour to fix an issue I was having with wlroots-based compositors :)

#### **Summary**

- Spend some time debugging issue where wlroots Vulkan renderer would consider DMA-BUF disjointed, causing it to fail when launching seemingly at random. This turned out to be related to inos not being set for DMA-BUF files in our DRM code.
- Create revision to always zero out stat struct before calling fo_stat: [D54556](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54556) (probably gonna be dropped in favour of next item).
- PR to drm-kmod to do the same but in dma_buf_stat: [freebsd/drm-kmod#401](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod/pull/401). This fixes the issue for now, but won't work for detecting DMA-BUFs that are actually disjointed.

#### **Next Steps**

- Figure out how Linux sets these inos so we can do the same.
