### Project: Laptop S0i3 Support

**Overall Status:** At Risk

#### **Summary**

- Review [D54158 - pcib: Add a new IVAR returning the Thunderbolt generation of a bridge](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54158).
- Spend some time gdebugin loading tb at boot causing panic (in tb_pcib).
- Remove PNP info to prevent PRs like 290827: 5bd839792b6a ("thunderbolt: Remove PNP info")

#### **Challenges**

- My machine doesn't seem to be exiting S0i3 with the new D-state code + USB4 driver loaded.

#### **Next Steps**

- Open revision for new ACPI D-state code and make sure all works.
- Figure out why I can't exit S0i3.
- Update SPMC and s2idle revision in response to olce@'s comments.
