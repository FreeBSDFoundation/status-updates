### Project: Updating Phabricator Instance to Phorge
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
Phabricator has been unmaintained for years and doens't play well with latest PHP versions.
#### **Completed Tasks**
 - Finished migration on test instance. Currently making a few final checks with Li-wen.
#### **Features Delivered**
 - Now uses latest software (including Phorge).
#### **Challenges**
#### **Blockers**
#### **Next Steps**
 - Reproduce upgrade path and notify clusteradm@ to do the actual upgrade on production.
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
 - Ihor and I are considering migrating bugzilla bugs to Phorge's Maniphest, providing integrated DX without two separate instance for bug report and patch review. We are referencing MediaWiki's example (although they wrote the migration logic in Python 2), and considering working on migration scripts using golang.

### Project: Raspberry Pi 4 Wifi driver on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
Raspberry Pi 4 uses brcmfmac-sdio driver which hasn't been ported to FreeBSD yet. This port will utilize linuxkpi
#### **Completed Tasks**
 - Learned basics of device drivers on FreeBSD through "FreeBSD Device Drivers: A Guide for the Intrepid".
#### **Features Delivered**
#### **Challenges**
 - linuxkpi doesn't support yet, so we need to port linuxkpi for sdio first. (Actually none of mmc driver API hasn't been delivered)
#### **Blockers**
#### **Next Steps**
 - Through email, Bjoern said he'll get back to me this week, so I'm waiting for his response for now.
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

### Project: Heterogeneous Multi-Processing Support on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
Create a machine-independent HMP interface for scheduler (currently aims only for sched_ule, no 4bsd support)
#### **Completed Tasks**
 - Finished initial planning on HMP structure that plays well with existing scheduler with SMP support.
 - Finish and created patch on `cpucap` framework. (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54674)
#### **Features Delivered**
#### **Challenges**
 - sched_ule is huge... First I need to go over `sched_ule.c` to see how code works (I know the concept, but never touched the code before)
#### **Blockers**
 - coredirector(4) patch series (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D44455) appeared two years ago but neglected. I emailed the author and he said he's willing to continue his work. This is basically ITD provider, but needs to be merged with the new `cpucap` framework
 - D54674 needs to be reviewed.
#### **Next Steps**
 - Add sysctl for `cpucap` framework so users can check cpucap status and capability and score per core.
 - Add manpage for hmp(4)
 - Integrate cpucap into sched_ule.
 - Add providers such as Intel ITD, dt, Arm SCMI, ACPI CPPC.
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
 - If this is enabled by default on 16-RELEASE, we're being very lucky. In other words, there is a lot of work and verification to do.

### Miscellaneous
#### **Summary**
Miscellaneous bug fixes, changes, etc.

#### **Completed Tasks**
 - Many stale PRs and reviews have been merged.
 - Removed remaining PowerPC SPE code. I won't remove any further code from now on as srcmgr@ already seems to be working on it right now.
 - Added doxygen requirement checks and updated requirement note.
 - During cpucap work, I found out checks for pcpu structure size is too loose, which caused wrong padding size to make the pcpu size factor of page size. This fixed a bug where arm64's pcpu took twice more space than it should. PR approved by Warner, waiting for merge.

#### **Features Delivered**
#### **Challenges**
#### **Blockers**
 - pcpu fix is waiting for merge (https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/pull/1955)
#### **Next Steps**
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
