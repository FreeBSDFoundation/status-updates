# February 2026 Status Update for Minsoo Choo

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-02-18 - 2025-02-24

### Project: LLDB Improvement for Kernel Debugging
#### **Overall Status:** At Risk
#### **Summary**
This is originally GSoC idea proposed by Ed.
Because this is long and frequently updated, I created a separate [document](kdb.md)
to track to track the progress.
#### **Completed Tasks**
- See [kdb.md](kdb.md)
#### **Features Delivered**
- See [kdb.md](kdb.md)
#### **Challenges**
- Since Shengyi is away, there isn't enough people to review my changes.
There are minimum 10 PRs I will create and creating them at once will cause merge conflict and merge hell.
So I'm trying to create PRs bit by bit instead.
#### **Blockers**
- Testing in non-x86 machines is difficult. I can use QEMU but it takes time and disk space.
Fortunately, we'll have ppc64be/le machine in our Kitchener office.
#### **Next Steps**
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
- For making FreeBSD kernel debugging on LLDB cross-platform, we have two options: 1) port kvm to LLDB in LLVM C++ style,
  or 2) convert minidump to ELF format on FreeBSD side and make LLDB handle ELF (for both fulldump and converted minidump).

### Project: Prepare Forgejo Review Ecosystem
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
I will create my own test instance of Forgejo and migrate Jenkins CI script to
Forgejo Runners.
#### **Completed Tasks**
- Finish setting up NUC for Forgejo.
#### **Features Delivered**
#### **Challenges**
#### **Blockers**
- I'm planning to work on this during AsiaBSDCon and while I'm in Korea.
#### **Next Steps**
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
- I'm considering Buildkite as an alternative until Forgejo Runner matures.

### Projects related to schedulers
#### **Overall Status:** Delayed
#### **Summary**
See below (EEVDF, kernel modules schedulers).
#### **Completed Tasks**
#### **Features Delivered**
#### **Challenges**
#### **Blockers**
- I'm too busy with LLDB stuff and there are already ongoing work on scheduler and I don't want
to add confusion.
#### **Next Steps**
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

- Too much effort is done on testing. The code change itself can be done by next week (I'm leaving Kitchener in two weeks),
but testing on different architectures is painful. I might have access to arm64 and ppc64le in future, but architectures like
i386, ppc, arm, and riscv64 is only available through QEMU.
#### **Blockers**

#### **Next Steps**
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
- LLVM 22 branching happened a few weeks ago and Dimitry's LLVM 21 work will be merged before I finish this. 
However, LLVM's internal API changes frequently and there might be challenges importing changes for LLVM 23 into our future LLVM 21 code. If this is too challenging, I'll wait for LLVM 22 import.
- Currently LLDB's FreeBSDKernel plugin either uses kvm (FreeBSD native) or libfbsdvmcore. libfbsdvmcore (fvc) is fork of kvm which is
cross-platform, but it is not actively maintained. The dual-provider mechanism makes testing harder, and since fvc isn't actively
used, I'm dropping support for it. This makes FreeBSDKernel non-crossplatform, but the correct way to achieve it is by directly
embedding kvm logic into LLDB source code instead of adding third-party library such as fvc.
