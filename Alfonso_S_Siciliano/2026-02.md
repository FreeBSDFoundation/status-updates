# February 2026 Status Update for Alfonso S. Siciliano

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)
## **Reporting Period:** 2026-02-11 - 2021-02-17

### Project: KDE installer dialogs
#### **Overall Status:** On Track for 15.1
#### **Summary**

The idea is: a user installs KDE at the end of bsdinstall through a series of dialog-based interfaces.
After rebooting, sddm starts and the user can log into the graphical environment.
[Repository](https://gitlab.com/alfix/kde-installer-dialogs).

Several pieces of feedback were received in response to the call for testing,
which can now be considered closed, although additional contributions are still welcome.

This week, work focused on implementing fixes based on the feedback and adapting the script for integration into bsdinstall.

#### **Completed Tasks**

 - The script installs and set up: xorg, KDE Plasma, and sddm after a fresh installation.

#### **Features Delivered**

 - The _desktop_ script, tested with: VESA, SCFB, Intel, and AMD.
 - Added (untested) menu to select NVIDIA GPUs.

#### **Challenges**

 - Testing GPU drivers.
 - GPU auto-detection.

#### **Next Steps**

 - Add VirtualBox.
 - Add VMware.
 - Adapt the script to bsdinstall.
 - Review for CURRENT.
