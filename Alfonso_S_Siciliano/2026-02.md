# February 2026 Status Update for Alfonso S. Siciliano

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)
## **Reporting Period:** 2026-02-18 - 2021-02-24

### Project: KDE installer dialogs
#### **Overall Status:** On Track for 15.1
#### **Summary**

The idea is: a user installs KDE at the end of bsdinstall through a series of dialog-based interfaces.
After rebooting, sddm starts and the user can log into the graphical environment.
[Repository](https://gitlab.com/alfix/kde-installer-dialogs).

Several pieces of feedback were received in response to the call for testing,
which can now be considered closed, although additional contributions are still welcome.

**Weekly Work Report**

- Fixed issues and implemented feature requests reported on GitLab and GitHub.
- Implemented automatic detection of the GPU and virtual machines. The detected GPU/driver is now shown as the suggested default option in the GPU (graphics driver) selection menu.
- Tested the script with VirtualBox and 15-STABLE. Everything works correctly. The script detects when it is running inside VirtualBox and installs the required additional packages.
- Improved button labels and dialog text.
- Started modifying the script for bsdinstall integration:
  - Included `/usr/share/bsdconfig/share` to use `$OSNAME`.
  - Prevented duplicate configurations from being rewritten when the script is executed multiple times. This is important if the script is added to the final bsdinstall menu section (`# bsdinstall finalconfig`).

#### **Completed Tasks**

 - The script installs and set up: gpu driver, xorg, KDE Plasma, and sddm after a fresh installation.

#### **Features Delivered**

 - The _desktop_ script, tested with: VESA, SCFB, Intel, and AMD.
 - Added menu to select NVIDIA GPUs (tested via Call for Testing).
 - GPU auto-detection.
 - VirtualBox option in GPU menu, auto-detection, and pkgs installation.

#### **Challenges**

 - Testing GPU drivers, mainly NVIDIA.

#### **Next Steps**

 - Add VMware option in the GPU menu.
 - Adapt the script to bsdinstall and review for CURRENT.
