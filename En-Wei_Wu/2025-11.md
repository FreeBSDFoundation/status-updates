# October 2025 Status Update for En-Wei Wu

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-11-12 - 2025-11-24

### Project: Laptop Project
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
These two weeks I have been implementing the S4 image phabricator
and S4 UEFI activator. Now we can simulate the S4 resume path
with them working together: S4 UEFI activator as a bootloader
recovers the states from the phabricated S4 image, then jump
to the trampoline code.

Now they are in a standalone public repo: [freebsd-s4-tools](https://github.com/rickywu0421/freebsd-s4-tools)

#### **Completed Tasks**
- Finished S4 image phabricator
- Finished S4 UEFI activator

#### **Features Delivered**
**S4 image phabricator** and its counterpart **S4 UEFI activator**.


#### **Challenges**
I avoid relying on the EDK2 library too much, since they will eventually be
integrated to FreeBSD loader, which depends on FreeBSD build system rather than EDK2.


#### **Blockers**
N/A
#### **Next Steps**
- Automate the testing by adding Github Action
- Modify the S4 UEFI activator to read S4 image from swap (now it loads S4 image from ESP)
- Review the [design document](https://hackmd.io/@eJNIw-SNShyq1LSp2azAcw/Bka-kXTpge) 
written by Konstantin

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
For `PT_FREEBSD_S4_PCB` segment, for now the S4 UEFI activator allocates 
a random page for the PCB payload (before `ExitBootServices()`), then pass 
the physical address of the start of the page to trampoline code, so 
trampoline code can access the PCB payload. I'm not sure if it's a good
way to do so.

### Project: Laptop Project
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
This week I've been mainly focusing on implementing the [S4 image fabricator](https://github.com/rickywu0421/s4img-mk-freebsd). Also, I helped clean up the Kitchener lab with Siva.

#### **Completed Tasks**
- Designed the S4 image phabricator 
- Looked into the kernel core dump format
- Help clean up the Kitchener lab

#### **Features Delivered**
N/A
#### **Challenges**
For Kitchener lab, we need to fill the internal documents for:
1. Inventory of hardware. (may be just a spreadsheet)
2. Hierarchy of the internet

#### **Blockers**
N/A
#### **Next Steps**
- Finish implementing the S4 image generator. Release and get feedbacks.
- Write a simple hello world trampoline in assembly, and have the S4 image phabricator read them and put into the image
- Help write the hardware inventory of Kitchener lab

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-10-28 - 2025-11-03

### Project: Laptop Project
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
This week I've started to design and implement an fabricated S4 image generator based on the [design docuemnt](https://hackmd.io/@eJNIw-SNShyq1LSp2azAcw/Bka-kXTpge). Also, I helped in the Kithchener lab to setup environemnt for remote access to the laptop hosted in the lab via KVM (not done yet).

#### **Completed Tasks**
- Designed the generator for fabricating an S4 image
- Discussed with Kib with the idea of the generator
- Involved in the Laptop Project meeting
- Helped to set up remote access in Kitchener lab

#### **Features Delivered**
N/A
#### **Challenges**
The setup of Kitchener lab isn't documented. Siva is thinking of documenting it and I will help with it.
#### **Blockers**
N/A
#### **Next Steps**
- Keep implementing the S4 image generator
- Once the image is generated, write a UEFI app to see if it can successfully parse the S4 image
- Keep going to Kitchener lab to help with the setup 

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
