# November 2025 Status Update for Olivier Certner

For the very beginning of November, see previous month's status report.


## **Reporting Period:** 2025-11-05 - 2025-11-11

Reduced period again, as I was traveling to the Vendor Summit and the 11/11 is
off.

### `mac_do(4)`/`mdo(1)`
- Work on the FreeBSD Journal article.
- PR 290352
  - D53455, D53456, D53457: MFC to stable/15
  - D53456, D53457: MFC to releng/15.0.
  - D53563: Commit.  I messed up the tests, and this change caused a panic at
    boot on INVARIANTS kernel, so was reverted by markj@.
  - Create D53636 ("proc_set_cred(): Allow 'newcred' to have multiple
    references") as a prerequisite for D53563.
  - Commit D53636 and recommit D53563.

### Vendor Summit
- Meet with people from several companies and discuss about their needs.
- Participate to a round-robin session, promoting recent work on
  `mac_do(4)`/`mdo(1)`, on DRM improvements for AMD GPUs and the scheduler.

### Review of others' work
- D53640 ("rm(1): remove whiteouts when forcibly removing directories"):
  Approve, as per an older discussion on D45987 ("tmpfs: Account for whiteouts
  during rename/rmdir").
- D53598 ("cd9660: Unbreak symbolic links") : Approve, suggesting a small simplification.
