# January 2026 Status Update for Olivier Certner

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-21 - 2026-01-27

### Dynamic P-state support (CPPC) \[Laptop Project\]
- [D54803](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54803) ("hwpstate: Add CPPC enable
  tunable"): Approve the new tunable that deactivates CPPC in favor of the old
  P-state interface.  Ask more questions about the exact scenarios.
- [PR 292615](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=292615)
  ("cpufreq changes causes AMD 4750U to run 11x slower"):
  - Transfer investigation information initially put on
    [D54803](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54803).
  - There are essentially two problems:
    1. `powerd(8)` cannot control CPPC (same problem in the Intel driver) since
       CPPC is not supposed to be controlled by core frequencies.  So `cy@`'s
       tuning of `powerd(8)` to control the temperature of his laptop does not
       work anymore, hence the new tunable to disable CPPC.
    2. `cracauer@` sees a huge drop in performance once CPPC is enabled,
       regardless of the EPP value.
  - Develop a patch to gather CPPC MSR values, get feedback from `cracauer@`.
  - Develop another patch that may fix `cracauer@`'s problem.
  - On top, add more control knobs so that all the standard CPPC quantities
    present in the `CPPC_REQUEST` register can be set/retrieved.  Proper tuning
    of these may well fit `cy@`'s use case.
- Small spin-off in the form of mostly cosmetic changes to `x86_msr_op()`, to be
  put to review.

### Scheduler
- Further discussion with several people, in particular about deprecation of
  4BSD (oh, boy...).
- Suggest to Minsoo a way to allow both schedulers to co-exist in the kernel
  (choosable at boot).
- Previous point superseded by `kib@`'s
  [D54831](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54831) ("Make ULE and 4BSD coexists").
  Review it, and approve after some iterations. (This will change the
  `SYSCTL(9)` knobs for the scheduler, as there is now an intermediate node
  named after the scheduler.)
- Page-in and slightly revise the design for fixing the unfairness problem
  (problem 2).

### Power / Suspend-to-idle (S0ix) \[Laptop Project\]
- Review [D48387](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48387) ("acpi_spmc: Add SPMC
  (system power management controller) driver"): More iterations to have the
  remaining problems fixed and some suggestions applied.  Finally approve.
- Start reviewing [D48735](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48735) ("acpi: Call SPMC
  suspend/resume hooks"): Suggest using the `EVENTHANDLER(9)` framework to run
  the hooks.

### Power / Hibernate (S4) \[Laptop Project\]
- Working on some clean-ups in `acpi.c`.
- Working on the code to output ELF headers as described in the HackMD document.
- Spin-off: Prepare an amendment to `sysctl_handle_bool()` to ensure
  backwards-compatibility of knobs whose type was changed from integer to
  boolean.


## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-14 - 2026-01-20

### Power / Hibernate (S4) \[Laptop Project\]
- More code analysis and design work
  - Quiescing the system
    - `stop_all_proc()`: To be launched from a kernel process.
    - `suspend_all_fs()`: Could be more strict with respect to errors.  Calls
      `vfs_write_suspend()` and thus `VFS_SYNC()`.  Looks like it should be enough
      (has been used for S4BIOS), but: What about the syncer?  Do we need to forcibly
      flush buffers in addition?
    - Using the `power_suspend_early` and `power_suspend` hooks is fine.
    - In order to avoid an inconsistent image with respect to devices (kernel
      threads, DMA, etc.), will need to suspend them before taking the snapshot.
  - Taking a snapshot
    - TODO: Discard cached vnodes.
    - TODO: Free all disk buffers.
    - TODO: Initiate the copy (analysis of `dumpsys()` to help with this).
  - Writing the image
    - Analyze of `doadump()`, `dumpsys()`, and the dump machinery (and setting
      GEOM devices as dump devices).
    - Reading spec of ELF format.
    - Just started: An alternative to `dumpsys()` that will emit an ELF image as
      described in the hibernate HackMD document.  Aim: Progress first to image
      production, even if inconsistent, so that `kib@` can test the resume path
      without having to wait for the final suspend path.
    - TODO: An alternative to `dumpsys()` that operates on an image rather than on
      the `dump_map[]`.
    - Identified a missing piece: Need to selectively wake-up the disk device to
      be able to actually write the image.
  - Shutting down the system
    - We absolutely cannot allow the system to write anything to disk after the
      image has been written.  Thus, we cannot use `shutdown_nice()` directly,
      because we cannot convey this constraint to `init(8)` (also, we do not
      want to run `rc.shutdown(8)`).  Looks like directly calling
      `kern_reboot()` like `RB_NOSYNC` should be enough.  To check: The shutdown
      hooks must not mess with filesystems on disk (but we still want to flush
      caches).
- BSDCan 2026: Submit a talk.

### Power / Suspend-to-idle (S0ix) \[Laptop Project\]
- Review [D54777](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54777) ("acpi: Fix not calling
  AcpiLeaveSleepState() in S3 path"): Approve (we missed this problem in
  [D48734](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48734)).
- New review for [D48387](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48387) ("acpi_spmc: Add
  SPMC (system power management controller) driver").  Some changes still to be
  done.
- Review [D54407](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54407) ("sched: Flag to force
  scheduler to always choose idle thread").  Suggest changes.  Globally on hold
  until we clarify what's going on in D54410.
- Review [D54410](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54410) ("acpi: Implement s2idle
  loop"): Asking for more details about the why, in order to check if we are
  really going into the right direction and to fuel the reflection on which
  basic blocks are really needed.

### Laptop Project Admin
- Attend the Power weekly meeting.

### `mac_do(4)`/`mdo(1)`
- AsiaBSDCon 2026: Work on and send a camera-ready paper.

### MAC framework (mac(4))
- Review [D54737](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54737) ("RELNOTES: document the
  MAC/jail integration"), suggest a change.
- Review [D54748](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54748) ("mac(4): also list jails
  in the example enumeration of objects"): Prompted by my comment in
  [D54737](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54737), approve.

### Scheduler
- Answer Minsoo Choo's mails about hybrid scheduling ("HMP"):
    - I have been working on the scheduler and cpuset sides of HMP.
    - More generally, on ULE, of which I'm the de facto maintainer.
    - Will review the `cpucap` framework at some point.
- Send a mail on `freebsd-hackers@` about some traits of ULE and some other
  schedulers (CFS).  Talk about ULE's current state, and which the most two
  pressing problems are.  State that I will address them in the coming
  weeks/months.  Rough description of the problems:
  1. The effect of nice values is too low, to the point of insignificance in
     most cases.
  2. There is a fairness issue for threads in-between interactive ones and CPU
     hogs, i.e., doing a non-trivial amount of computation so that they are not
     considered interactive, but at the same which frequently do not use the
     full quantum.  In this situation, with the current code, the amount of
     not-used quantum is simply lost.
- Evoke the project to eventually deprecate 4BSD if the new ULE is shown to be
  on par with it for scenarios where people have been using 4BSD (HPC scenarios
  essentially).  Further discussion with several people happens.

### Power / Hibernate (S4) \[Laptop Project\]
- Start modifying `sys/dev/acpica/acpi.c`, in particular
  `acpi_EnterSleepState()`, to support OS-initiated S4.  First step: Quiescing
  the system.  Read some more aspects of S4 sleep/wakeup in the ACPI spec.
- There's some technical debt though, so work on some small changes around
  that code.  Consequently, work on and create:

    AcpiGetSleepTypeData() to determine Sx support")

  problems, finally approve.
- New review of [D48387](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48387) ("acpi_spmc: Add
  SPMC (system power management controller) driver"): Review latest changes by
  `obiwac@`, and some parts I didn't have time to last time, in particular
  treatment of Low Power S0 Idle device constraints and plumbing of `acpi_spmc`
  into the ACPI framework.  Request and suggest more changes.
- Start reviewing:
  - [D54407](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54407) ("sched: Flag to force
