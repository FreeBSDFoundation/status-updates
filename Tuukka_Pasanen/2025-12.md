## Reporting Period: 2025-12-01 - 2025-12-02

### Project: SBOMs (STA - WPE)
#### Overall Status:
At Risk

#### Summary
I was sick on Monday, so a little bit of converting things to Alpha-Omega beach cleaning has been done.

#### Completed Tasks
None

#### Features Delivered
Lua script to create `.pc` files from CSV file and CSV file creation from existing data.

#### Challenges
As said earlier, there aren't any licenses attached, and there won't be many in this time frame.

#### Blockers
Still no plan on how to upstream this work.

#### Next Steps
Update Alpha-Omega beach cleaning with this information, but it needs conversion from CSV to YAML.

#### Open Questions and Discussion
What should be done about the `pkg(8)` situation?

### Project: Ports and Packages Sec (STA - WPD)
#### Overall Status:
On Track

#### Summary
There hasn't been much activity in this area, but Google noticed that our PR hasn't progressed further in 
[PR#3901](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues/3901).

#### Completed Tasks
Updated the PR.

#### Features Delivered

#### Challenges
Getting a real OSV database up will be the first task after the Zoom meeting, but as always, progress is slow to get anything through.

#### Blockers
There isn't an official OSV database yet.

#### Next Steps
Create an official OSV database and start using it.

#### Open Questions and Discussion
Where will this OSVf JSON database be located?
