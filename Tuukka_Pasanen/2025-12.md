# [12] [2025] Status Update for [Tuukka Pasanen]

[//]: <Week 51>

## Reporting Period: 2025-12-10 - 2025-12-16

### Project: SBOMs (STA - WPE)
#### Overall Status:
At Risk

#### Summary
Licenses have been added to the Alpha-Omega beach cleaning `database.yml` from files that contain **SPDX-License-Identifier** tags. These licenses have not been verified against the actual file contents.

#### Completed Tasks
All files with **SPDX-License-Identifier** tags have been added to `database.yml`.

#### Features Delivered
A new Lua script has been created to add licenses from a CSV file to `database.yml`.

#### Challenges
Upstreaming changes to FreeBSD-src remains challenging.

#### Blockers
There is still no plan for upstreaming this work.

#### Next Steps
Update pkgconfig files.

#### Open Questions and Discussion
It's likely that this project will not be upstreamed within the current timeframe.

### Project: Ports and Packages Sec (STA - WPD)
#### Overall Status:
On Track

#### Summary
The `pkg(8)` Pull Request has been run through Clang `lsan` (LeakSanitizer), and a leak in the [pkg(8) curl fetching code](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2569) has been fixed. The OSV test repository 
is up-to-date, and documentation is prepared. Scripts are ready for either converting VuXML or starting fresh with OSV.

#### Completed Tasks
The pkg(8) PR is ready to be merged once the official OSV database is available. The OSV repo is now ready for deployment.

#### Features Delivered
The OSV test repository is ready for deployment.

#### Challenges
Obtaining a real OSV database and making it operational remains challenging. Additionally, ensuring that documentation reaches a level where the OSV database no longer requires manual intervention is 
difficult.

#### Blockers
There isn't an official OSV database yet, and the pkg(8) audit implementation has not been merged.

#### Next Steps
Create an official OSV database and start using it.

#### Open Questions and Discussion
Where will this OSVf JSON database be located?

Update Alpha-Omega beach cleaning with this information, but it needs conversion from CSV to YAML.

#### Open Questions and Discussion
What should be done about the `pkg(8)` situation?
