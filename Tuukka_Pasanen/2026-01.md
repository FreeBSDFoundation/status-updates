	# 01 2026 Status Update for Tuukka Pasanen

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)
## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-28 - 2026-01-30

### Project: SBOMs (CRA)
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
Update Scancode-toolkit to latest one. As new version is much stricter with licenses and does not make assumptions when it doesn't understand what license is used. Created a new simple Jinja2 template to only have filename and license on the same line.

Found out which C/C++ files and headers are missing SPDX-License-Identifier. Also updated `database.yml`.


#### **Completed Tasks**
* None


#### **Features Delivered**
* None

#### **Challenges**
There are pretty awkward licensing headers in some files. Mostly they're okay, but then there are some that don't contain any license like: `sbin/route/route_netlink.c`, or the license has some extension 
or is shortened, e.g., BSD-4-Clause.


#### **Blockers**
Currently none.

#### **Next Steps**
Add the found licenses to files. At least start with easy ones and then see what remains.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
How detailed should the SBOM be? Only top dirs like `bin`, `sbin`, `usr.bin`, and `usr.sbin` or per application?

## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-19 - 2026-01-27

### Project: SBOMs (CRA)
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
Started new contract with FreeBSD Foundation and continued SBOM creation task. Started to add commands from /usr/bin, /usr/sbin/, /bin, and /sbin. They are mostly covered currently; the remaining applications are mainly from source in the contrib directory.

Added a man page for pkgconf's **spdxtool**, which is used for creating SPDX Lite 3.0.1 compatible SBOM. Also made some code adjustments like converting functions to use `const` when needed.

#### **Completed Tasks**
* Update functions to be const [pkgconf pr#446](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/446)
* Add `__attributes__` to printf-like functions [pkgconf pr#447](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/447)
* Added first draft for [SBOM documentation](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning/blob/illuusio/sbom-document/sbom.md)

#### **Features Delivered**
* Updated compatibility to get pkgconf to compile in FreeBSD src

#### **Challenges**
Tracking applications left that are from contrib, determining if they are already covered, is slow.

#### **Blockers**
Currently none.

#### **Next Steps**
Get all applications covered and start working on serious Makefile integration

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
When SBOM is done? Every build or just when needed?
