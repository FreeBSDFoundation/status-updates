# 01 2026 Status Update for Tuukka Pasanen

[//]: <> (### Add weekly updates in reverse chronological order. ###)
## **Reporting Period:** 2026-01-19 - 2026-01-24

### Project: SBOMs (CRA)
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**
Started new contract with FreeBSD Foundation and continued SBOM creation task. Started to add commands from /usr/bin, /usr/sbin/, /bin, and /sbin. They are mostly covered currently; the remaining applications are mainly from source in the contrib directory.

Added a man page for pkgconf's **spdxtool**, which is used for creating SPDX Lite 3.0.1 compatible SBOM. Also made some code adjustments like converting functions to use `const` when needed.

#### **Completed Tasks**
* Update functions to be const [pkgconf pr#446](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/446)
* Add `__attributes__` to printf-like functions [pkgconf pr#447](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/447)
* Added first draft for [SBOM documentation](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning/blob/illuusio/sbom-document/sbom.md)

#### **Features Delivered**
* Updated compatibility to get pkgconf to compile in FreeBSD src

#### **Challenges**
Tracking applications left that are from contrib, determining if they are already covered, is slow.

#### **Blockers**
Currently none.

#### **Next Steps**
Get all applications covered and start working on serious Makefile integration

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
When SBOM is done? Every build or just when needed?
