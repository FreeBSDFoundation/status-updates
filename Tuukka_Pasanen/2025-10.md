# [10] [2025] Status Update for [Tuukka Pasanen]

[//]: <Week 44>
## **Reporting Period:** [2025-10-29] - [2025-11-04]

### Project: SBOMs (STA - WPE)
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
Upstream pkgconf merged:
- [Add License.file-tag to libpkgconf](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/431)
- [Add SPDX Lite profile 3.0 generator](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/429)
Which means that all SPDX Lite 3.0 PR's are merged.

Tried to get [FreeBSD PURL PR](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/496) forward. It seems to be stalled.

#### **Completed Tasks**
Merging SPDX SBOM stuff to upstream pkgconf is now mainly done
#### **Features Delivered**
SBOM can be created from `.pc` files
#### **Challenges**
Some changes are still missing and need to be implemented, like multi-license option and multi-license files parameter. They alter working stable stuff so it needs to be altered very carefully that nothing gets broken.
#### **Blockers**
Currently none.
#### **Next Steps**
Start producing more `.pc` files and review Pierre's work
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
Is there anything else missing in pkgconf?

### Project: [Ports and Packages Sec (STA - WPD) ]
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
Exported VuXML to test OSV database and created a Lua tool to verify [OSVF files which can be found](https://github.com/illuusio/vuln-test/blob/main/bin/osvf-tool.lua). Created PR to [osv-schema](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/448).
#### **Completed Tasks**
Updated OSV database to be up-to-date and fixed some bugs. Delivered the first version of Lua tool to merge and validate OSV files. Implemented example Github workflow to test CI.
#### **Features Delivered**
See Completed Tasks
#### **Challenges**
Get tooling ready for launch
#### **Blockers**
Not currently
#### **Next Steps**
Implement `pkg(8)` code for parsing array of JSON.
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
Which template should convert to OSVf JSON? Would it be FreeBSD Security Advisory format or something else?

### Project: SBOMs (STA - WPE)
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
**Lua modules and functions for ports are now committed for review:**
- [Lua logging module to be used in FreeBSD ports](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53316)
- [Lua Process and manage the output of the make command](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53317)
- [SBOM target to Mk/bsd.port.mk and needed Lua scripts](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53318)

**GitHub updates:**
- [pkgconf PR#427](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/427) has been merged.
- [pkgconf PR#431](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/431) has been added.
- [pkgconf PR#429](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/429) has been updated.

#### **Completed Tasks**
Lua SBOM's are now up for review
#### **Features Delivered**
Lua SBOM modules and functions. Pkgconf Source-tag
#### **Challenges**
pkgconf is tied with Alpine 3.23 which slows pkgconf review down.
#### **Blockers**
Get code to upstream
#### **Next Steps**
Start producing more `.pc` files and review Pierre's work
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
Is there anything else missing in pkgconf?

### Project: [Ports and Packages Sec (STA - WPD) ]
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
Updated [https://github.com/illuusio/vuln-test][FreeBSD test OSV Vulnerability database] to comply with the latest documentation and remove unnecessary stuff. Now it should be reviewed to see if it's ready 
for production.
#### **Completed Tasks**
Checked out VuXML to OSVf script and created a first full export of a random date VuXML database.
#### **Features Delivered**
First version of FreeBSD test OSV Vulnerability database which could be exported and used in production
#### **Challenges**
There is tooling left to-do like melding all OSVf files into one JSON array and having some sane template to work on. Also, `bsddialog` base OSV tool needs final thought.
#### **Blockers**
Not currently
#### **Next Steps**
Do needed scripts
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
None

### Project: SBOMs (STA - WPE)
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
Focusing on integrating SBOM tool to pkgconf (a package management tool). The PR [https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/429](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf/pull/429) now reflects progress toward 
enabling automated package dependency tracking and metadata collection, critical for security and compliance. This work aligns with SBOM standards for transparency in software supply chains.
#### **Completed Tasks**
Added SBOM PR to pkgconf
#### **Features Delivered**
After integration pkgconf can deliver SPDX Lite 3.0.1 files from `.pc`files

#### **Blockers**
Get code to upstream
#### **Next Steps**
Start producing more `.pc` files
#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
Do we want to use this or LUA version?

### Project: [Ports and Packages Sec (STA - WPD) ]
#### **Overall Status:**
On Track
#### **Summary**
