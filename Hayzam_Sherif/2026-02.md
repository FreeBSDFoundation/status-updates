# **February - Week 4 - 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** February 16, 2026 – February 23, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

#### **Summary**

This week I reported some issues with the Bhyve VNC RFB code and got 2 patches [757b0bf](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/commit/757b0bf5cf46230bcbeeb298f734b9bb7cde1817) and [818971c](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/commit/818971cc403e78d42b77eb6c18a2d2a073e5541f) merged, thanks to @markj for getting it commited! While working on the documentation for Sylve, I also parallely started working on a cluster-wide backup system based on the tool Zelta.

I was able to implement a working prototype for cluster-wide backups using Zelta (for datasets and jails) on the branch cluster-improvements, which is now being tested. This will allow users to easily backup and restore their VMs and Jails across the entire cluster, providing an additional layer of data protection and disaster recovery.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Reported and got 2 patches merged for Bhyve VNC RFB code
* Continued working on documentation for Sylve
* Implemented a working prototype for cluster-wide backups using Zelta
* Fixed a bunch of off-by-one errors in the clustering UI and also the RAFT implementation

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue testing and improving the cluster-wide backup system
* Continue working on documentation and user guides for Sylve

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

# **February - Week 3 - 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** February 9, 2026 – February 16, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week some left over implementation was done for jails (primarily around editing lifecycle hooks/other options). I also added qemu-guest-agent support for VMs, both in the backend and UI. We now show the guest agent status in the VM details page (just OS details and networking for now). A number of issues on the github repo were also fixed and closed.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Made a lot of performance and QoL improvements to the VNC backend, it's now a bit faster, and allows users to take over existing sessions 
* Added qemu-guest-agent support for VMs, showing basic info in the UI (OS details and networking for now)
* Added support for editing lifecycle hooks and other options for jails
* Replaced PATH-based calls with absolute binary paths for better reliability and security
* Moved CI from self-hosted jenkins to Github Actions

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on user-reported bugs and improvements
* Continue working on documentation and user guides for Sylve

# **February - Week 2 - 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** February 2, 2026 – February 9, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week I implemented a `-console` flag for Sylve which allows users to make changes without having access to the web UI, also fixed some UI issues and made some performance improvements for the UI, particularly around the Table componenet.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Implemented a REPL `-console` flag
* Added `ifconfig descr` for epairA of jail vnets'
* UI: TreeTable performance improvements

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on user-reported bugs and improvements
* Continue working on documentation and user guides for Sylve

# **February - Week 1 - 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** January 26, 2026 – February 2, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

Fixed a bunch of bugs related to initialization, also improved terminal for both VM serial console as well as Jails. Completely removed the dependency on smartmontools as well as tmux, we no longer have any strict dependencies, everything is optional.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Migrated away from smartmontools to a CGO implementation of smart(8)
* Fixed bugs related to initialization (dependency checks)
* Fixed left panel when clustering is enabled
* Improved S.M.A.R.T display UI in the disks section

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on user-reported bugs and improvements
