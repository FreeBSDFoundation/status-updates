# **February - Week 3 - 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** February 9, 2026 – February 16, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week some left over implementation was done for jails (primarily around editing lifecycle hooks/other options). I also added qemu-guest-agent support for VMs, both in the backend and UI. We now show the guest agent status in the VM details page (just OS details and networking for now). A number of issues on the github repo were also fixed and closed.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Made a lot of performance and QoL improvements to the VNC backend, it's now a bit faster, and allows users to take over existing sessions 
* Added qemu-guest-agent support for VMs, showing basic info in the UI (OS details and networking for now)
* Added support for editing lifecycle hooks and other options for jails
* Replaced PATH-based calls with absolute binary paths for better reliability and security
* Moved CI from self-hosted jenkins to Github Actions

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on user-reported bugs and improvements
