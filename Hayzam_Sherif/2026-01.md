# **January 2026 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** December 30, 2025 – January 5, 2026

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, following the merge of the refactor branch into master, I focused on fixing post-merge bugs reported by users and improving overall stability.

I also set up VS Code’s Remote Development to work with our FreeBSD development VM, replacing our old SSHFS/NFS workflow. After a few codebase tweaks, the experience is now much smoother and lowers the barrier for new contributors using VS Code.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Fixed a bunch of post-merge bugs reported by users
* Improved overall stability of Sylve
* Set up VS Code Remote Development for our development machines with Linuxulator

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Start working on documentation and also a landing page for Sylve
* Re-do CI for getting frontend builds for ports and releases
