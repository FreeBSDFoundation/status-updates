### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I pushed several fixes related to jail management mainly improving fstab handling and mount point logic. I also fixed bugs in user and group creation, and resolved an issue with network switch assignment for VMs and jails.

I also started setting up a new FreeBSD 15 CI server (jenkins) to replace our old one which has been decommissioned. This will help us get back to running automated tests and builds for Sylve.

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on writing documentation for Sylve, including a user guide and (small-ish) developer guide. We've started taking some user feedback on this and figured the best way to document the project would be to have a website with all the relevant information, that is part of the Sylve monorepo. We'll be pushing the docs to the master branch soon, under a revamped `docs/` directory.

I also fixed some bugs that were reported by users, mostly around S.M.A.R.T. monitoring and disk management and also the associated UI components.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Started work on documentation
* Fixed bugs around S.M.A.R.T. monitoring and disk management

#### **Blockers**

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on documentation and also a landing page for Sylve
* Fix CI (build testing is now broken) to use newly setup server

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, following the merge of the refactor branch into master, I focused on fixing post-merge bugs reported by users and improving overall stability.

I also set up VS Code’s Remote Development to work with our FreeBSD development VM, replacing our old SSHFS/NFS workflow. After a few codebase tweaks, the experience is now much smoother and lowers the barrier for new contributors using VS Code.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Fixed a bunch of post-merge bugs reported by users
* Improved overall stability of Sylve
* Set up VS Code Remote Development for our development machines with Linuxulator

#### **Blockers**

* None at the moment

#### **Next Steps**

* Start working on documentation and also a landing page for Sylve
* Re-do CI for getting frontend builds for ports and releases
