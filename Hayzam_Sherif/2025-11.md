# **November 2025 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** November 24, 2025 – December 1, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on refactoring the Jails component, and also adding more features to the existing jail management capabilities. Linux jails are now supported (with the help of the linux compatibility layer), and users can now create, start, stop, and manage Linux jails through the Sylve interface. We also added a bunch of flags to customize the jail creation process, every hook and allow.* options are now supported right from the UI and also the API.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Refactored Jails component for better maintainability
* Added support for Linux jails, including creation, starting, stopping, and management through the UI
* Implemented various flags for jail creation, including every hook and allow.* options
* Improved error handling and user feedback for jail operations
* Started experimenting with ghostty-web as a potential replacement for XTerm.js for better performance and features

#### **Blockers**

* Same as before

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the jails rework some edit options are still pending
* Continue experimenting with ghostty-web for remote console functionality

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I updated some libraries used within Sylve to their latest versions to ensure compatibility and security (some critical Go standard library updates). Improved internationalization (i18n) libraries and fixed several bugs related to login/logout workflow. We also improved the downloader to have a "category" based approach for better organization of available OS images/base files. The noVNC client was modified to support error handling and reconnection attempts for a more robust remote console experience. 

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Updated several libraries to their latest versions
* Improved i18n libraries and fixed login/logout workflow bugs
* Enhanced downloader with category-based organization for OS images/base files
* Modified noVNC client to support error handling and reconnection attempts for a more robust remote console experience

#### **Blockers**

* Bhyve RFB only supports a single connection at a time, which limits multiple concurrent remote console sessions

#### **Next Steps**

* Continue working on storage rework for jails (which was pushed back due to library updates and bug fixes)
* Test and finalize the downloader improvements

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I completed the UI changes for the dataset management rework, allowing users to attach existing volumes and disks to their VMs. The new interface simplifies the process of managing storage resources.

I also implemented cloud-init support for Sylve, enabling users to easily configure their VMs during the initial boot process.

VMs now support shutdown and reboot operations in both the interface and the API.

Additionally, we migrated away from remote APIs for all of our frontend icon components to improve performance, reliability, and reduce external dependencies.


#### **Completed Tasks**

* Completed UI changes for dataset management rework
* Implemented cloud-init support for Sylve
* Added shutdown and reboot support for VMs in the interface and API
* Migrated frontend icon components away from remote APIs
* Fixed bugs related to storage UI and CPU allocation modal

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Finalize storage rework for jails
* Merge `storage-refactor` branch into main development branch after thorough testing

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I completed the UI changes for CPU allocation and pinning modal, which now supports both single and multi-socket CPUs. The new modal provides a more intuitive interface for users to allocate CPU resources to their VMs. Additionally, I also started working on the UI changes required for the dataset management rework, now attaching existing volumes and disks are now supported as well.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Some storage UI implementation related to dataset management rework
* Fix bugs associated with CPU pinning/allocation modal and also DB schema migrations
* Committed above changes to `storage-refactor` branch

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete UI changes for dataset management and also new vCPU allocation model
