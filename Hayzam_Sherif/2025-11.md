# **November 2025 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** November 03, 2025 – November 10, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I completed the UI changes for CPU allocation and pinning modal, which now supports both single and multi-socket CPUs. The new modal provides a more intuitive interface for users to allocate CPU resources to their VMs. Additionally, I also started working on the UI changes required for the dataset management rework, now attaching existing volumes and disks are now supported as well.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Some storage UI implementation related to dataset management rework
* Fix bugs associated with CPU pinning/allocation modal and also DB schema migrations
* Committed above changes to `storage-refactor` branch

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time
