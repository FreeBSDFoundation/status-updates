# **December 2025 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** December 1, 2025 – December 8, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on updating the Go ZFS library used in Sylve, primarily to start using the new JSON output features for better performance and reliability when interacting with ZFS pools, datasets and snapshots. The go library is now a separate package available at [github.com/alchemillaHQ/gzfs](https://github.com/alchemillaHQ/gzfs), which will allow for easier maintenance and updates in the future.

Additionally, I made further improvements to the jail management features, addressing some pending edit options.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Updated Go ZFS library to leverage new JSON output features (ZFS Version 2.3+ required)
* Started refactoring ZFS interactions in Sylve to use the updated Go ZFS library
* Continued improvements to jail management features

#### **Blockers**

* Same as before

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the refactoring of ZFS interactions in Sylve
* Finalize pending jail management edit options
