# **December 2025 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** December 15, 2025 – December 22, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week I worked on an issue reported by a user which was getting 100K+ snapshots load snappily in the UI. This involved optimizing the data retrieval and rendering processes to handle large datasets more efficiently. We now watch things like devd events to keep in sync with changes happening outside of Sylve, which has greatly improved the user experience as well.

We also completed integration with the gzfs library for ZFS interactions for the pools and datasets views, which has improved performance and reliability greatly, this is a 15.0+ feature.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Optimized snapshot loading to handle a lot of snapshots efficiently in the UI
* Integrated gzfs library for ZFS interactions in pools and datasets views in the UI
* Improved synchronization with external changes (ZFS) via devd event watching

#### **Blockers**

* Same as before

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week I focused on continuing the refactoring of ZFS interactions in Sylve's UI to make use of the updated Go ZFS library that leverages the new JSON output features. This change is expected to improve performance and reliability when interacting with ZFS pools, datasets, and snapshots.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Implemented/Updated handlers for getting ZFS status, pools, datasets, and snapshots using the updated Go ZFS library
* Tested out Sylve on ARM64 where I discovered libvirt was not working correctly; I have reported this issue to the libvirt maintainer for further investigation.

#### **Blockers**

* Same as before
* Libvirt issue on ARM64 affecting Bhyve management

#### **Next Steps**

* Start working on the pending jail management edit options

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on updating the Go ZFS library used in Sylve, primarily to start using the new JSON output features for better performance and reliability when interacting with ZFS pools, datasets and snapshots. The go library is now a separate package available at [github.com/alchemillaHQ/gzfs](https://github.com/alchemillaHQ/gzfs), which will allow for easier maintenance and updates in the future.

Additionally, I made further improvements to the jail management features, addressing some pending edit options.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Updated Go ZFS library to leverage new JSON output features (ZFS Version 2.3+ required)
* Started refactoring ZFS interactions in Sylve to use the updated Go ZFS library
* Continued improvements to jail management features

#### **Blockers**

* Same as before

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the refactoring of ZFS interactions in Sylve
* Finalize pending jail management edit options
