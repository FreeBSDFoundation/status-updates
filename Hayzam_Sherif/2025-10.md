# **October 2025 Status Update â€” Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** October 20, 2025 â€“ October 27, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve â€” GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on interacting with community members to gather feedback on Sylveâ€™s features and usability before the beta release. And due to popular demand we started reworking how datasets for VMs and Jails are arranged, now the user can select a parent dataset for all VMs and Jails, making management easier (for both us and the users).

We also started working on an improved modal for vCPU allocation and also pinning, which will support both single and multi-socket CPUs.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* None for this week, as the focus was on community engagement and planning. The UI work is under development under a different branch and will be merged once complete.

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Migrate dataset arrangement changes to the `master` branch
* Complete the new vCPU allocation and pinning modal
* Continue working on backup system for VMs and Jails

### **Project:** Sylve â€” GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on enhancing Sylveâ€™s reliability and performance. Major work included implementing **retention policies for ZFS snapshots**, optimizing the **built-in downloader** for faster transfers and automatic decompression, and improving subsystem performance across various components â€” notably the **Wake-on-LAN (WoL) server** for Jails and VMs.

Additionally, I began developing the **cluster backup system**, which will initially support both **S3-based** and **directory-based** backups.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Implemented **ZFS snapshot retention policies**
* Improved **network/interfaces UI table** to display detailed information (e.g., epairs, bridges)
* Enhanced **DHCP server (dnsmasq-based)**:

  * Added **static lease** support
  * Improved **UI for configuration and range management**
* Refactored internal downloader to support **automatic file decompression** and **faster performance**

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the **VM and Jail backup system**
* Begin **documentation preparation** for upcoming **beta user release**
