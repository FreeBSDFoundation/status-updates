### **Project:** Sylve â€” GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on enhancing Sylveâ€™s reliability and performance. Major work included implementing **retention policies for ZFS snapshots**, optimizing the **built-in downloader** for faster transfers and automatic decompression, and improving subsystem performance across various components â€” notably the **Wake-on-LAN (WoL) server** for Jails and VMs.

Additionally, I began developing the **cluster backup system**, which will initially support both **S3-based** and **directory-based** backups.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Implemented **ZFS snapshot retention policies**
* Improved **network/interfaces UI table** to display detailed information (e.g., epairs, bridges)
* Enhanced **DHCP server (dnsmasq-based)**:

  * Added **static lease** support
  * Improved **UI for configuration and range management**
* Refactored internal downloader to support **automatic file decompression** and **faster performance**

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the **VM and Jail backup system**
* Begin **documentation preparation** for upcoming **beta user release**
