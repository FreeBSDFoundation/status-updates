# **October 2025 Status Update — Hayzam Sherif**

## **Reporting Period:** October 27, 2025 – November 03, 2025

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on finalizing the backend changes required for reworking dataset management for VMs and Jails. The new system allows users to select a parent dataset for all VMs and Jails, simplifying management and improving organization. The backend part is now complete and have been committed to the `storage-refactor` branch. Since this is breaking change we have also taken the liberty to update other internal models to better align with this new structure and also improve features along some other areas like vCPU allocation.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Finalized backend changes for dataset management rework
* Committed changes to `storage-refactor` branch

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete UI changes for dataset management and also new vCPU allocation model

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on interacting with community members to gather feedback on Sylve’s features and usability before the beta release. And due to popular demand we started reworking how datasets for VMs and Jails are arranged, now the user can select a parent dataset for all VMs and Jails, making management easier (for both us and the users).

We also started working on an improved modal for vCPU allocation and also pinning, which will support both single and multi-socket CPUs.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* None for this week, as the focus was on community engagement and planning. The UI work is under development under a different branch and will be merged once complete.

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Migrate dataset arrangement changes to the `master` branch
* Complete the new vCPU allocation and pinning modal
* Continue working on backup system for VMs and Jails

### **Project:** Sylve — GUI for Managing Bhyve, Jails, and More on FreeBSD

**Overall Status:** 🟢 *On Track*

#### **Summary**

This week, I focused on enhancing Sylve’s reliability and performance. Major work included implementing **retention policies for ZFS snapshots**, optimizing the **built-in downloader** for faster transfers and automatic decompression, and improving subsystem performance across various components — notably the **Wake-on-LAN (WoL) server** for Jails and VMs.

Additionally, I began developing the **cluster backup system**, which will initially support both **S3-based** and **directory-based** backups.

#### **Completed Tasks**

* Implemented **ZFS snapshot retention policies**
* Improved **network/interfaces UI table** to display detailed information (e.g., epairs, bridges)
* Enhanced **DHCP server (dnsmasq-based)**:

  * Added **static lease** support
  * Improved **UI for configuration and range management**
* Refactored internal downloader to support **automatic file decompression** and **faster performance**

#### **Blockers**

* None at this time

#### **Next Steps**

* Complete the **VM and Jail backup system**
* Begin **documentation preparation** for upcoming **beta user release**
