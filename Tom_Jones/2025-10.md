# October 2025 Status Update for Tom Jones

## **Reporting Period:** 2025-10-13 - 2025-10-19 (Week 43)

### Project: Improve FreeBSD Kernel Debugging
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

FreeBSD offers a variety of kernel debugging interfaces, the main interface
available on all systems is using the system console, typically via a graphics
interface. On modern system the graphics driver is routed via a GPU which
requires a lot of code to drive. This can lead to situations when the graphics
system crashes or the graphics output stops functioning where interactive
debugging is impossible or debugging at all isn't possible.

This project aims to provide a debugging mechanism that will work in the
absence of a functional graphics driver, first by updating and upstreaming xHCI
debug, by documenting and improving other debug interfaces and my adding
support for debugging interfaces in newer systems.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- [ ] Test loader xhci debug support
- [ ] Debug stall in xhci debug console start up
- [ ] Design an adapter board for usb-c <-> usb3 and usb-c DAM.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- [x] Design and submit for manufacturing rev 1 of a usb-c debug adapter mode
      activator

#### **Next Steps**

- [ ] Start review process for xhci debug loader with caveat on start up stall

#### **Challenges**

Debugging doesn't function in the pre kernel environment in bhyve. A resolution
is to move development to qemu KVM on Linux with pcie pass through.

#### **Next Steps**

- [ ] Start review process for xhci debug loader with caveat on start up stall
- [ ] Design an adapter board for usb-c <-> usb3 and usb-c DAM.
    - update board with pcb edge connectors
    - respin with a 4 layer pcb
