### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Not the most productive week on my behalf, a few other obligations came in the way, but finally got the remaining patches for the new openjdk bootstrap process committed, had some progress on porting some changes from mainline to the bsd-port, and confused myself by juggling too many jdk25.0.2 branches. Also discussed how to deal with release notes for jdk update ports with Greg and Kurt. Yeah, and I pushed the current bsd-port branch from the battleblow repo to a baseline branch in the openjdk/bsd-port repo to initiate upstreaming of the port.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- OpenJDK mainline FreeBSD work:
  - There's quite a lot of upstream changes to the mainline that need more work to port now that jdk26 has been branched out.
  - Worked on updating w^x handling on Aarch64 after changes to the MacOS port in this area.
  - Synced default poller provider against MacOS implementation. Further testing needed to check that this still work as expected on the BSD's also.
- Update `java/openjdk25` port to OpenJDK 25.0.2.
  - Worked on bringing over the BSD related fixes relevant to the port. Some issues on Aarch64 held it back a bit, but should be mostly resolved now.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Pushed the current mainline BSD port to a baseline branch on the openjdk/bsd-port repo:
  - Repo link: https://github.com/openjdk/bsd-port/tree/dev
  - List post: https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/bsd-port-dev/2026-February/003250.html (No idea how, or why, this was turned into a bloated HTML email along the pipeline.)
- Redo bootstrapping OpenJDK ports:
  - [D54731](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54731): java/openjdk21-25: Bootstrap from prebuilt packages. ([committed](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=8de6fe603338d529fb9ef6c744a5a676370de59b))

#### **Features Delivered**

- Bootstrapping OpenJDK ports no longer depend on the previous port being available and built. This means we can remove non-LTS ports from the ports tree without building later ports breaking. This is already in progress. We can also remove the bootrstrap-openjdk ports, as they are no longer needed.

#### **Challenges**

Still one flaky test in the Serviceability Agent that I need to dive into.

#### **Blockers**

None.

#### **Next Steps**

- Finish openjdk25 update.
- Begin work on openjdk26.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

Got some feedback from one OpenJDK user that it would be nice to include the upstream release notes in whenever we update the ports to the latest upstream releases. It's not always obvious from the version numbers if the release contains potentially breaking changes. The case prompting this was the release of OpenJDK 11.0.30, which disabled all `TLS_RSA` cipher suites, which causes some disruptions in their internal network.

There's concern that adding more work to the release process will strain the already time constrained task too much. We're considering a low effort approach that will not burden the maintainers with extra work once in place.

### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

This week I have been working on preparing an update for the `java/openjdk25`
port to version 25.0.2 (released upstream January 18).

I've also worked on integrating changes from upstream mainline into the
mainline bsd-port at the battleblow/jdk/bsd-port branch. This time there were
some changes to how W^X flags on code segments were handled, which caused some
extra work on our part. There were also some changes to hoe default poller
implementation, that needs more testing to ensure that the BSD implementation
still works as it should.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- OpenJDK mainline FreeBSD work:
  - Merge upstream changes, update w^x handling on Aarch64 and sync default poller provider against MacOS implementation.
- Update `java/openjdk25` port to OpenJDK 25.0.2.
- Redo bootstrapping OpenJDK ports:
  - [D54731](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54731): java/openjdk21-25: Bootstrap from prebuilt packages:
    - Rebased on main to include updated OpenJDK 21 port

#### **Completed Tasks**

- OpenJDK mainline FreeBSD work:
  - PR: [battleblow/jdk #37](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) Fix sa agent on FreeBSD (closed).
  - PR: [battleblow/jdk #38](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38) Alternative sa fix (merged).
- Update `java/openjdk25` port to OpenJDK 25.0.2.
  - [battleblow/jdk25u PR #8](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/8): Backport Serviceability Fixes. (merged)
  - [battleblow/jdk25u PR #9](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/9): Backport allocateNativeInternal fix. (merged)

#### **Features Delivered**

None this period.

#### **Challenges**

Still one flaky test in the Serviceability Agent that I need to dive into.

#### **Blockers**

None.

#### **Next Steps**

- Finish openjdk25 update.
- Begin work on openjdk26.
- Push battleblow/jdk/bsd-port to openjdk/bsd-port/dev as baseline for upstream bsd-port.

### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Finally found and fixed the remaining issue causing consistent test failures in
the Serviceability Agent on FreeBSD. There's still some sporadic failures due
to `ptrace(2)` calls sometimes failing for unknown reasons. I've submitted two
potential fixes for the Serviceability Agent: One that tries to [align with the
MacOS](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) implementation, and one that
[builds directly on the existing](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38)
BSD implementation. There are some advantages and disadvantages to both
approaches, but currently it seems the alternative that does _not_ try to align with the MacOS way of doing things works slightly better.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- Started on updating openjdk25 port to JDK 25.0.2.
- Review: [D54731](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54731): java/openjdk21-25: Bootstrap from prebuilt packages:
  - Rebased on main to include updated OpenJDK 21 port
- PR: [battleblow/jdk #37](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) Fix sa agent on FreeBSD.
- PR: [battleblow/jdk #38](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38) Alternative sa fix:
  - This one looks more promising to me, but may be split into two or there separate PR's.

#### **Completed Tasks**

None this period.

#### **Features Delivered**

None this period.

#### **Challenges**

- Land SA agent fix in mainline bsd-port.
- Begin work on openjdk26.
- Push battleblow/jdk/bsd-port to openjdk/bsd-port/dev as baseline for upstream bsd-port.
