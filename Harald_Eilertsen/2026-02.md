### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

This week I have been working on preparing an update for the `java/openjdk25`
port to version 25.0.2 (released upstream January 18).

I've also worked on integrating changes from upstream mainline into the
mainline bsd-port at the battleblow/jdk/bsd-port branch. This time there were
some changes to how W^X flags on code segments were handled, which caused some
extra work on our part. There were also some changes to hoe default poller
implementation, that needs more testing to ensure that the BSD implementation
still works as it should.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- OpenJDK mainline FreeBSD work:
  - Merge upstream changes, update w^x handling on Aarch64 and sync default poller provider against MacOS implementation.
- Update `java/openjdk25` port to OpenJDK 25.0.2.
- Redo bootstrapping OpenJDK ports:
  - [D54731](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54731): java/openjdk21-25: Bootstrap from prebuilt packages:
    - Rebased on main to include updated OpenJDK 21 port

#### **Completed Tasks**

- OpenJDK mainline FreeBSD work:
  - PR: [battleblow/jdk #37](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) Fix sa agent on FreeBSD (closed).
  - PR: [battleblow/jdk #38](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38) Alternative sa fix (merged).
- Update `java/openjdk25` port to OpenJDK 25.0.2.
  - [battleblow/jdk25u PR #8](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/8): Backport Serviceability Fixes. (merged)
  - [battleblow/jdk25u PR #9](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/9): Backport allocateNativeInternal fix. (merged)

#### **Features Delivered**

None this period.

#### **Challenges**

Still one flaky test in the Serviceability Agent that I need to dive into.

#### **Blockers**

None.

#### **Next Steps**

- Finish openjdk25 update.
- Begin work on openjdk26.
- Push battleblow/jdk/bsd-port to openjdk/bsd-port/dev as baseline for upstream bsd-port.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Finally found and fixed the remaining issue causing consistent test failures in
the Serviceability Agent on FreeBSD. There's still some sporadic failures due
to `ptrace(2)` calls sometimes failing for unknown reasons. I've submitted two
potential fixes for the Serviceability Agent: One that tries to [align with the
MacOS](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) implementation, and one that
[builds directly on the existing](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38)
BSD implementation. There are some advantages and disadvantages to both
approaches, but currently it seems the alternative that does _not_ try to align with the MacOS way of doing things works slightly better.

#### **Ongoing Tasks**

- Started on updating openjdk25 port to JDK 25.0.2.
- Review: [D54731](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D54731): java/openjdk21-25: Bootstrap from prebuilt packages:
  - Rebased on main to include updated OpenJDK 21 port
- PR: [battleblow/jdk #37](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/37) Fix sa agent on FreeBSD.
- PR: [battleblow/jdk #38](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/38) Alternative sa fix:
  - This one looks more promising to me, but may be split into two or there separate PR's.

#### **Completed Tasks**

None this period.

#### **Features Delivered**

None this period.

#### **Challenges**

Still one flaky test in the Serviceability Agent that I need to dive into.

#### **Blockers**

None.

#### **Next Steps**

- Finish openjdk25 update.
- Land SA agent fix in mainline bsd-port.
- Begin work on openjdk26.
- Push battleblow/jdk/bsd-port to openjdk/bsd-port/dev as baseline for upstream bsd-port.
