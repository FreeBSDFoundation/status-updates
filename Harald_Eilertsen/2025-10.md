### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Started ports committer mentorship mentored by fuz@ and bofh@, and released a port for OpenJDK25 to the ports tree.
Also joined OpenJDK org on Github to enable work on the upstream bsd-port. Still waiting for push access to the repo, but Greg Lewis is looking into it.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Submitted talk proposal about project to FossNorth 2026
- Dug into the history of the `getrlimitusage(2)` system call discovering it was available since version 14.2 despite what the man page says:
  - https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/4
  - Related: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53320 by emaste
- Added new port `java/openjdk25`:
  - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53326
  - https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=dd93e1a47a370390e1730fcaab11fd83a0fc64ea
- Reviewed changes to battleblow/jdk repo:
  - https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/19

#### **Features Delivered**

- OpenJDK 25 in ports

#### **Blockers**

- Lacking push access to openjdk/bad-port repo prevents me from getting the repo ready for beginning upstream work.

#### **Next Steps**

- Improve openjdk ports to use FLAVORS for building jre and headless variants.

### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Have been away for most of this period, so not much work done.
Submitted FreeBSD patches for OpenJDK mainline to [battleblow/jdk](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15).
Also started looking into setting up my own Aarch64 VM for testing.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Merged upstream openjdk mainline into [battleblow bsd-port](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15) branch.
- Moved patches from my mainline branch onto [battleblow bsd-port](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15) branch.
- Reviewed [PR #17](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/17) from bsdkurt.

#### **Features Delivered**

- None this period

#### **Challenges**

- Some test still fail on the battleblow branch that works on my mainline branch. Needs more investigation.

#### **Blockers**

- Lacking push access to openjdk/bad-port repo prevents me from getting the repo ready for beginning upstream work.

#### **Next Steps**

- Establish the branches for upstream work in the [openjdk/bsd-port](https://github.com/openjdk/bsd-port) repo.
- Revisit openjdk25 port to release on FreeBSD.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
