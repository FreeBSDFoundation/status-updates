### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Have been away for most of this period, so not much work done.
Submitted FreeBSD patches for OpenJDK mainline to [battleblow/jdk](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15).
Also started looking into setting up my own Aarch64 VM for testing.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Merged upstream openjdk mainline into [battleblow bsd-port](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15) branch.
- Moved patches from my mainline branch onto [battleblow bsd-port](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/15) branch.
- Reviewed [PR #17](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/17) from bsdkurt.

#### **Features Delivered**

- None this period

#### **Challenges**

- Some test still fail on the battleblow branch that works on my mainline branch. Needs more investigation.

#### **Blockers**

- Lacking push access to openjdk/bad-port repo prevents me from getting the repo ready for beginning upstream work.

#### **Next Steps**

- Establish the branches for upstream work in the [openjdk/bsd-port](https://github.com/openjdk/bsd-port) repo.
- Revisit openjdk25 port to release on FreeBSD.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
