### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

The upstream OpenJDK project has finally finished setting up our [`bsd-port`](https://github.com/openjdk/bsd-port) repository, so that we can start the work on upstreaming the port. We've had some good discussions among the BSD port team on how to proceed and organize the work. I also spent some time bringing in some minor upstream changes to the BSD port, and on figuring out the root cause of why the Memory Alignment test would intermittently fail on FreeBSD. A fix for this has been submitted for review directly upstream, as it's not directly related to the BSD port.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Synced battleblow/jdk bsd-port branch with upstream mainline ([PR#20](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/20)).
- openjdk/bsd-port repo finally set up with a bsd-port branch for upstreaming patches.
  - Good discussions with both glewis and bsdkurt on structuring the work going forward.
- Thought I had found a fix for `TestMemoryAlignment` being flakey on FreeBSD, but found after some contemplation [that the fix was wrong](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/21#issuecomment-3510718913).
- Cleaning up some dead code and obsolete practices to bring the BSD port in line with mainline ([PR#22](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk/pull/22)).
- Finally figured out a solution for `TestMemoryAlignment` being flakey on FreeBSD:
  - JBS: https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8371637
  - PR: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/28235

#### **Features Delivered**

None this period.

#### **Challenges**

None.

#### **Blockers**

None.

#### **Next Steps**

- Check feasibility of creating a jre-headless flavor of the openjdk port ([Bug #266059](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=266059))
- Backport memory alignment fix to openjdk 24 and 25 ports.
- Sync the work from [battleblow/jdk](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk) to a new branch on the openjdk/bsd-port repo.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**

- Should we make new openjdk versions available also in the quarterly branch of the ports tree?
  - Mailing list: https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-java/2025-November/003365.html

### Project: Improve OpenJDK on FreeBSD
#### **Overall Status:** On Track
#### **Summary**

Most of this past week was spent on adding `-jre` and `-headless` flavors to the java/openjdk25 port, as well as testing the flavors by running various Java apps. I've also spent some time on getting an Aarch64 VM up and running locally to enable me to build and test the aarch64 build of the JVM. This is still ongoing.

Also started looking into [Bug 290447](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290447) about implementing `sun.nio.fs.AbstractWatchService` by using the `kqueue` API on FreeBSD. This should provide better performance than the current generic `PollingWatchService` used currently.

#### **Completed Tasks**

- Added flavors for building jre and headless variant to java/openjdk25 port:
  - Review: [D53450](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D53450)
  - Commit: [fe94eea5557](https://cgit.FreeBSD.org/ports/commit/?id=fe94eea55572b109ad291b3607ba59caff917a7e)
- Reviews for others:
  - battleblow/jdk25u: [PR#5: Backport mainline changes](https://github.com/battleblow/jdk25u/pull/5)

#### **Features Delivered**

- `-jre` and `-headless` flavors for java/openjdk25.

#### **Challenges**

- Testing on Aarch64 and PowerPC is lacking at the moment, but work is underway to remedy the situation.

#### **Blockers**

- Still missing push access to openjdk/bsd-port repo.

#### **Next Steps**

- Get up to date on changes in upstream mainline.
- Start looking at OpenJDK 26.

#### **Open Questions and Discussion**
